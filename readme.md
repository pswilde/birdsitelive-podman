# This is a simple Podman setup script for the birdsiteLIVE service

This script will initialize a podman pod with required containers to run your own
instance of the [birdsiteLIVE](https://github.com/NicolasConstant/BirdsiteLive) service.  

You will need to configure your Twitter API credentials and admin information.  
You will also need to configure your own Reverse Proxy service and TLS certificates.
